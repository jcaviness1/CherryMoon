               <p style="color:peachpuff">Defining my usage of "soft things," I have implemented anime/"kawaii" elements into this site as well as used soft pastels throughout the pages to create a "light" theme, while using a black background to create balance. As you can see, the videos I have also included are all playlists of various music that I like, however there are two playlists that are mainly kpop to emphasize my definition/mainstream definition of a "soft" aesthetic in terms of music. I have also included emoticons, as well as "aesthetic" symbols to implement a  "y2k" theme in addition to the "soft" theme. Again, although I am very proud of this site as it is my very first one, it is not expected to be taken seriously. If anything, this was for experimental purposes!
