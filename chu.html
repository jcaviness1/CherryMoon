    <p style=color:peachpuff>I am aware that this site is not a serious piece of work, and it is not meant to be taken
        seriously, it may even be deemed as inappropriate to some, however I feel as though this is a great learning
        experience for me as not only am I learning, but I also actually am enjoying it! I love how working with
        technology in this way is allowing me to be creative whilst thinking logically. I feel as though I am developing
        a healthy balance of both! Although not a portfolio or a biography, this site is just meant to show off one part
        of my personality, and that's my soft, cute side where I enjoy soft things ♡ </p>
