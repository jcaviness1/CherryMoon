Although I did not originally intend for this website to be taken seriously, as this site does not contain a sole purpose other than redirecting to a signup form, it has provided me with a basis for me to practice and test on various skills including HTML, CSS, Javascript, utilizing various packages and frameworks such as node-fetch, nodemon, bootstrap, troubleshoot various server related issues with Windows Powershell, and utilizing process managers, as well as an API. For now I will not consider this website finished, as I am looking to expand the site by adding new features and functionalities, as well as to continue testing and applying new skills.

This site implements pop culture "anime/kawaii/kpop" theme elements, music, pastel color contrast, gifs, images, and various fonts in order to create a "soft" and "y2k" aesthetic, as a form of self-expression.

I started off creating three HTML webpages as well as a Javascript file inside of one folder.

In a separate folder is where I utilized node.js, express, bootstrap, and a MailChimp API to create a club signup form, which will add a user to my newsletter list

In order to provide constant runtime to the website, I installed a process manager called PM2. I ran Windows Powershell as an administrator in order to troubleshoot various problems with running my server.

One problem I ended up fixing by changing the execution policy to discard server restriction

Another where I had to install a package in order to activate pm2 startup, a command that continues the runtime of my server on pm2 in the case of crashes or reboots.
